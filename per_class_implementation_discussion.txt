**Work in Progress**

✓ = verified to be completely implemented up to v580

# General ToDos
TODO: testnet mode (e.g. different Genesis block) not implemented yet.
TODO: Java Maps offer natural deduping of keys, we might have missed one or the other deduping, should be checked.
TODO: actually distribute the genesis block with the binary.

# ApprovedCycleTransaction.java ✓

Simple data type.

# BlockFileConsolidator.java ✓

This is part of the block file handler in Go, works pretty similarly otherwise.

# RunMode.java ✓

Small utility class in Java to keep track of the run mode aka. node type. In go, we added this to interfaces/context
for convenience. Implementation is quite different, but should lead to similar results.

# SeedTransactionManager.java ✓

This is part of the transaction manager in Go, implementation is pretty similar apart from that. In Go, as in Java,
the seed transaction manager is pretty fragile (depending on a centralized online repo). Astonishing that no bigger
issues came up for it in the past.

# Verifier.java

In Java, the Verifier class loads and freezes the genesis block. This moved to the block authority in Go, which appears
more natural. Also, Java tries to load the genesis block from a trusted source, which appears fragile. In Go, we
distribute the genesis block with the node package and move it in place during configuration.EnsureSetup.

# sentinel/Sentinel.java

Like all other node types, the sentinel is tied into the general node framework.

- managed verifiers are loaded in node manager
- the cycle is bootstrapped in cycle authority
- the bootstrap block is fetched by the block authority (if needed)

Overall, this leads to a pretty different bootstrap process compared to Java, but given intense testing, the end
result should be the same, and the changes should not be consensus relevant. The more event driven architecture
of the Go implementation requires different approaches in these areas, trying to replicate Java 1:1 would lead
to a very atypical use of Go. 

TODO: automatic sentinel whitelisting (v579)

# sentinel/SentinelUtil.java ✓

See sentinel/Sentinel.java

# web/*

Not implemented yet, not consensus relevant. Go could take a different approach here, offering complementary services
to the Java node, like the Archive node, or a JSON based interface.
